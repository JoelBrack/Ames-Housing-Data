# Ames-Housing-Data

This project is not yet completed, but will hopefully be finished soon. It currently features different models for predicting housing prices by linear regression, Random Forests, LASSO regression, RIDGE regression, and possibly XGBoost. The data cleaning and EDA file is published above.
