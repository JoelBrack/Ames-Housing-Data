# Ames-Housing-Data

I completed a project using this data for a class project during my Masters. In the project I compared several modeling techniques including linear regression, LASSO regression, and RIDGE regression. Further work on this project could include XGBoost and Random Forests (I learned about these techniques after completing this project). I have posted the cleaning and EDA file above but am focusing on other projects (using Python) at the moment. I might revisit this in the future. 

To summarize the results of the project, a linear model with stepwise selection criteria actually outperformed the Ridge and LASSO models created. The in-sample and out-of-sample MSE's were lowest in the linear model. I hypothesize that an XGBoost model might best the linear model if explored.
